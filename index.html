                        CEO, Gravity Payments<br><br>
                        
                        Dan Price is widely known as the CEO who set his company’s starting pay at $70,000 per year after having an enlightening conversation with a friend of his. Learning that she and many of his own employees earn less than what they would need to live a quality life, Price decided to look at his company’s financials to see if it was possible to increase his employee’s wages. To do so, he needed to cut back his own pay. So, he did.
